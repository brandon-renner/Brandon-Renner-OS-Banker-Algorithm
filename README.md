# OS-Banker-Algorithm

#

# This project and its program aims to implment the Banker Algorithm, used to analyze the state of a computer system in order to avoid a deadlocked state with the specifications set by the assignment for this Operating Systems class

#

# This project was written in the C++ language, and were developed in a Linux-POSIX environment to be run with the use of an input text file, containing necessary information for execution

#

# To run this code, use the following commands in sequence:

# $ g++ banker.cpp -lrt -o banker

# $ ./banker

#

# This project does not require any user inputs, and should run correctly once being executed, successfully displaying and formatting the file input information and determining the system state
